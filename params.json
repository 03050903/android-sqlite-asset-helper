These will include the initial SQLite database file for creation and optionally any SQL upgrade scripts.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n-------\r\n\r\nAuthor: [Jeff Gilfelt](http://jeffgilfelt.com)\r\n\r\nThe code in this project is licensed under the Apache Software License 2.0.\r\n  \r\nCopyright (c) 2012 readyState Software Ltd."}
